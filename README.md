# Jeannie 8-voice polyphonic VA/Wavetable Synthesizer with digital State Variable/Ladder Filter

Jeannie is an 8-voice polyphonic open source synthesizer kit with digital VA/Wavetable sound synthesis and digital filters based on a fast ARM Cortex-M7 processor with 1MByte RAM. A variety of classic and band-limited waveforms are available to the user for sound generation. A pool of 15 waveform banks, each with 63 different waveforms and 54 wavetables, offer plenty of scope for sound experiments. A waveshaper with different characteristics ensures distortions that range from gentle to evil. To tame the waveforms, there is a digital 12dB multimode filter with fade function from low-pass to high-pass and a band-pass function. There is also a 24dB LP ladder filter. A 24-bit DSP effects module with adjustable parameters rounds off the sound synthesis. An integrated polyphonic 16-step sequencer ensures the playfulness of the small synthesizer. A total of 2048 sound patches from 15 banks can be loaded and saved via an integrated SD card. A color 1.8 inch TFT display enables a clear menu structure and easy operation of the synthesizer. The parameters are entered using four rotary knobs below the display and an encoder for selecting the sound programs and switching to the menu functions. In addition, there are six buttons for operating special synthesizer functions.
