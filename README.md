# Jeannie - A DIY Polyphonic open-source synthesizer

Jeannie is an open-source DIY synthesizer with 8 voices, which supports digital sound synthesis and filters while being powered by a [Teensy 4.1](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html)

The user has a variety of classic and band-limited waveforms at their disposal which can be selected from a pool of 15 waveform banks with 63 different waveforms each, offering plenty of space for sound experiments. The waveshaper provides from gentle to vicous sounding distortions, while also having different characteristics

To tame the waveforms, Jeannie has a digital 12dB multimode filter which also allows you to fade from low-pass to high-pass and a band-pass function. In addition, the 24dB LP ladder-filter version of the firmware can be flashed as well.

A 24Bit DSP effect module with adjustable parameters allows rounding off the sound synthesis.

The integrated 16-step, polyphonic sequencer provides for the playfulness of this synthesizer.

Not only is the user able to create their own sounds, but samples can also be loaded from a total of 2048 patches from 15 banks, stored on the MicroSD card.

A 1.8" TFT display creates the clear menu structure and allows for easy operation of the synth while five rotatable knobs and six buttons on the device are the input method to select sound programmes, switching between the menu functions and even enable special ones.

The in- and outputs also include MIDI in and out, a headphone jack, a micro-usb port to update the synthesizer's firmware, a MicroSD port and a DC barrel jack for power.
