# Jeannie 8-voice polyphonic open source synthesizer with 24dB Ladder Filter and 12dB State Variable Multimode Filter

Jeannie is an 8-voice polyphonic open source synthesizer kit with digital sound synthesis and digital
filters based on a fast ARM Cortex-M7 processor with 1MByte Ram. For sound generation, the user has
a variety of classic and band-limited waveforms at his disposal. A pool of 15 waveform banks with 63
different waveforms each offer plenty of space for sound experiments. A waveshaper with different
characteristics provides for gentle to vicious sounding distortions.
To tame the waveforms, there is a digital 12dB multimode filter with fade function from low-pass to highpass
and a band-pass function. In addition, there is a 24dB LP ladder filter. A 24Bit DSP effect module with adjustable parameters rounds off the
sound synthesis. An integrated polyphonic 16-step sequencer provides for the playfulness of the small
synthesizer.
A total of 2048 sound patchesfrom 15 banks can be loaded and stored via an integrated SD card. A
color 1.8 inch TFT display allows a clear menu structure and easy operation of the synthesizer. The
parameters are entered via four rotary knobs below the display and an encoder for selecting the sound
programmes and switching to the menu functions. In addition, there are six buttons for operating special
synthesizer functions.
